## How to Send Media Files

You can also send media files such as Images, Audios, PDFs and Videos. To do so, add a "Custom Payload" response in your Dialogflow intent with the code:

    {
	    "mediaUrl": "<<YOUR URL>>"
    }

You can optionally include a **text** paramater to send a message alongside the image:

    {
	    "mediaUrl": "<<YOUR URL>>",
	    "text": "<<YOUR MESSAGE>>"
    }
